# Feminae
Our project aims to reshape women’s healthcare through an AI-powered platform that integrates personalized support across various stages of their reproductive health journey. The system will provide tailored advice based on menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and postpartum stages using advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models and dynamic prompts. Real-time health tracking will empower users with insights to optimize wellness, while a smart Chat Application will deliver precise answers related to medical queries. The platform will also integrate seamlessly with users' medical schedules, offering a calendar page with timely notifications. An SOS feature will ensure quick access to emergency contacts. This comprehensive solution not only addresses immediate health concerns but also fosters long-term health improvement, making it an indispensable tool for women’s well-being.
